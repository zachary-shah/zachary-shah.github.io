### Stable Diffusion for Audio Inpainting
Code ([riff-cnet](https://github.com/zachary-shah/riff-cnet)) ([riff-pix2pix](https://github.com/zachary-shah/riff-pix2pix)) | Paper <a id="raw-url" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zachary-shah/zachary-shah.github.io/master/assets/writing/StableDiffusionAudioInpainting.pdf">(Download)</a>

![AudioGeneration](assets/img/AudioGeneration.png)

This project aims to generate new instrumentation into acoustic audio using Stable Diffusion technology. By turning audio into mel-spectrogram images, text prompts can direct a spectrogram image edit to "paint in" a desired change to the audio, such as adding a singer's voice. Using both ControlNet and InstructPix2Pix as methods to control the desired generative changes, this project introduces the idea of musical decomposition learning, or learning the conditional distribution of an instrument given other classes of instruments.

### Convex Optimization of 2-layer Neural Networks

![ScalableAdmm](assets/img/ScalableADMMNN.png)

This project reformulates the non-convex training landscape of a ReLU-activated neural network as a convex optimization problem solved via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). We examine three practical ADMM based methods for solving this reformulated problem, and examine their performance with GPU acceleration on PyTorch and JAX. The main contribution to this work is exploring stochastic and preconditioned approximations to meliorate the expensive linear systems solve of the ADMM algorithm. This project examines scalability and acceleration of these methods, in order to encourage applications across a wide range of statistical learning settings.

![KneeMonitor](assets/img/KneeMonitor.png)

My undergraduate senior design project, in collaboration with the Army Research Lab. We created a wearable knee sleeve to monitor long-term arthritic joint swelling. After conducting extensive interviews with sports practitioners and rheumatologists, we discovered that clinical professionals lack the capabilities to provide reliable quantified metrics of the progression of arthritis. To address this, we quantified the fluidic swelling of a joint by building a wearable monitor, employing a custom fabricated printed circuit board and strain sensors built from liquid-metal alloys embedded into a silicone mesh. To gauge joint swelling, I designed a calibration model to map strain-induced voltages from these sensors to geometric measures across the knee. To demonstrate the patient use-case, I developed a web app using React to display real-time joint measurements collected via Bluetooth.

### Console Gaming Injury Prediction via EMG

![EMGForGaming](assets/img/EMGForGaming.png)

An undergraduate class research project to indicate strain injury risks during console gaming. I designed a data acquisition system with an Arduino to collect a subjectâ€™s electromyogram (EMG), a measure of the electrical activity of muscles, into MATLAB. We examined what regions of the EMG power spectral density could be used as an indicator classify forearm fatigue during extended periods of gaming.

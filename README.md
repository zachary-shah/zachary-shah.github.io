### Joint Health Monitoring System

TODO: picture here

I participated in a Capstone Senior Design Project in collaboration with the Army Research Lab and the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Our team created a wearable knee sleeve to monitor long-term arthritic joint swelling. After conducting extensive interviews with rheumatologists, sports practitioners, and arthritis patients, we discovered that clinical professionals lack the capabilities to provide reliable quantified metrics of the progression of arthritis, especially limiting the use of telemedicine for their practices. To address this, we aimed to quantify the fluidic swelling of a joint by building a wearable monitor in the form of a sleeve, employing a custom fabricated printed circuit board and strain sensors built from liquid-metal alloys embedded into a silicone mesh. Since we built these sensors ourselves, I designed a calibration model to map strain-induced voltages from these sensors to geometric measures across the knee. To demonstrate the patient use-case, I developed a web app using React to display real-time joint measurements collected from the sleeve via Bluetooth.

### BCG Hearbeat Segmentation

TODO: Picture Here

This was a project with the Physiological Monitoring and Modulation Lab at Georgia Tech under Dr. Omer Inan pertaining to the development of a ICU hospital bed leveraging the ballistocardiogram (BCG), a waveform detected by force plates detailing the mechanical response of the cardiac system, to non-invasively monitor blood pressure. Every year, millions of patients admitted to the ICU suffer from stroke or death due to hypertension. Thus, providing a simple method of continuously monitoring blood pressure to predict these adverse health outcomes could alert hospital staff when intervention is necessary. My contribution to this project involved developing software to autonomously identify the BCG’s characteristic features useful for deriving cardiac metrics. To do so, I am building a deep learning model in Python to differentiate motion artifacts and noise from the desired portions of the BCG signal. Since feature detection in noisy signals is probabilistic and leads to weakly annotated data, I am applying multiple instance learning to classify BCG features at an aggregate level, rather than at an instance level. This improved predictions of atypical blood pressure events in the hospital compared to other standard DL frameworks like RNNs or GANs.

A class research project to indicate strain injury risks during console gaming. I designed a data acquisition system with an Arduino to collect a subject’s electromyogram (EMG), a measure of the electrical activity of muscles, into MATLAB. We examined what regions of the EMG power spectral density could be used as an indicator classify forearm fatigue during extended periods of gaming.
